I have used just about every noodle variety under the sun to make this mac and cheese recipe and it always turns out delicious! I do recommend a shape (bowties, rotini, etc.) instead of spaghetti noodles, but they do work if it’s all you have! You can also use gluten-free pasta, whole wheat pasta, chickpea pasta, etc. etc. Butter. There really isn’t a substitute for butter in this recipe. However you can use either salter or unsalted with great results! All-Purpose Flour. There are a few substitutions that work well for the flour including corn starch, tapioca starch/flour, and all-purpose gluten-free flour. I do not recommend whole wheat flour, as it give this mac and cheese recipe a wheaty taste. Milk. Any kind of liquid dairy works well in this recipe. Just remember the higher the fat content, the creamier your homemade mac and cheese will be (so I do not recommend using fat-free milk). 2% milk, whole milk, half and half and cream all work well! My favorite is whole milk! Sour Cream. I have used Greek Yogurt in place of sour cream with excellent results. I would save I’ve made it equally with sour cream and Greek yogurt and my family can never tell the difference! Sure you could use a low-fat variety of either one of these ingredients, but you will be sacrificing the creaminess of the final result. Cheese. NOTE: The quality of the cheese that you use in this homemade mac and cheese recipe really matters. If you wouldn’t eat it by itself, then don’t use it to make mac and cheese! I recommend a high-quality medium to sharp cheddar cheese for the best flavor! Salt & Pepper. Add these ingredients to taste! Garlic powder. This ingredient is optional but I think it adds just a touch of flavor that takes this mac and cheese recipe up a notch without making it unpalatable to kids. Adjust the amount to your family’s tastes!'},
